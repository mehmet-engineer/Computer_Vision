# Computer Vision and Implementations with Python

It contains all the python usage codes I wrote, including basic and advanced topics. There are also sample projects in the repo. Image processing/Computer Vision topics for beginners are listed below;

## 1) Image Processing Basics (OpenCV, Numpy)

• RGB, BGR, HSV, GRAY color channels

• Matrix data type, image reading ve numpy usages

• Cartesian coordinates in the image

• Slice and resize images

• Line, shape and writing operations

• Adding and blending in images

• Canny edge and corner detection

• Hough Circle theory and circle detection

• Masking and bitwise operations

• Blur, smoothing and morphology

• Histogram and contrast equalization

• Reading and writing images from the camera

• Video and fps definition, waitkey() function


## 2) Advanced Image Processing (OpenCV, Numpy)

• HSV color space and properties

• Contours and drawing

• Color detection, color filtering and masking

• Trackbar and its usage

• Opening and closing methods

• Feature detection

• HoughLine theory and implementation

• Object Detections with Haar Cascade

• Car and lane detection

• Angle finder project

• Human and face detections

• Panaroma implementation

• QR Code Scanner

• Object Tracking
